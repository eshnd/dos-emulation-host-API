# how to install
- THIS IS FOR LINUX USERS ONLY (it's possible to install on mac and windows but you're gonna have to do it manually)
- clone the repo and cd into the ```ins``` folder
- run ```source install.sh```
- follow the installation instructions
- once it's done, ```source``` either your ```.bashrc``` or ```.zshrc``` depending on what shell you use (only bash and zsh are supported by the install script)
- run ```dosemu-linux```
- boom! it's installed
